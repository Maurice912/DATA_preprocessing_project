# Data Preprocessing / Data Acquisition Project

This project explores global country-level indicators by combining a Kaggle dataset 
with web-scraped data (Life Expectancy and Education Index).  

## Folder Structure
- `data/` — raw and scraped datasets  
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks for each step  
- `README.md` — project overview  

## Goal
To practice data acquisition, cleaning, merging, and visualization using Python (pandas, seaborn).
